# DevII-fall21
Repository for exchanging materials for DevII (Eco 842) at The GC

- This is a (soon to be private) repository for sharing materials and class discussions. We will use it to:
   - Post questions and comments to Issues
        - Comments for [class 3 on Structural Transformation](https://github.com/jhconning/DevII-fall21/issues/1)
- A separate website and repo at [jhconning.github.io/DevII](https://jhconning.github.io/DevII) contains lecture notes, slides and other materials (under construction).

Once I have everyone's github handles, I'll make this private.
